##Welcome
This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Jekyll. We’ll cover topics such as getting your site up and running, creating and managing your content, customizing the way your site works and looks, deploying to various environments, and give you some advice on participating in the future development of Jekyll itself.

##So what is Jekyll, exactly?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

{% highlight python %}
def shift_n_letters(letter, n):
    letter_pos = ord(letter)
    letter_plus_n = letter_pos + n
    if letter_plus_n <= 122 and letter_plus_n >= 97:
        return chr(letter_plus_n)
    elif letter_plus_n > 122:
        return chr(96 + letter_plus_n - 122)
    return chr(122 - (96 - letter_plus_n))
{% endhighlight %}

[Aaron Swartz][] deserves a tremendous amount of credit for his feedback on the
design of Markdown's formatting syntax. Markdown is *much* better thanks
to Aaron's ideas, feedback, and testing. Also, Aaron's [html2text][]
is a very handy (and free) utility for turning HTML into
Markdown-formatted plain text.

[Nathaniel Irons][], [Dan Benjamin][], [Daniel Bogan][], and [Jason Perkins][]
also deserve thanks for their feedback.
