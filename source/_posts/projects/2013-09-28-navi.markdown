![Navi]({{ root_url }}/assets/navi_1.png "Roadmaps For Learning")

Navi is the bookish intellectual stepchild of Reddit and Wikipedia. Users create and share &ldquo;roadmaps&rdquo; or paths of content they found helpful while they were getting up to speed on a particular topic. Content is organized into mini-slideshows (iframes) and voted up or down based on educational quality.
