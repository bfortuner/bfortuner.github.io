Trends With Friends combines the competitive addictive elements of the stock market with the social and fun nature of pop culture. Users buy and sell "trends" of athletes, authors, movie stars, politicians, and brands and earn points when their trends increase in popularity. The asset pricing model is based on a combination of in-app supply/demand, twitter sentiment analysis, and google search frequency.
