<!-- BEGIN blog/about/index.html -->
<p>Brendan Fortuner grew up in the small town of Litchfield, Connecticut. He left shortly after to attend the University of Virginia where he accumulated credits in philosophy and business. He also joined a fraternity, sang in an all-male a capella group, frequented a debating society, wrote for a humor publication, and from time to time, attended class. Despite his greatest desire to remain at the university forever, a minor administrative oversight involving the incorrect rounding of floats gave him one credit too many and he was promptly graduated. Downtrodden and lacking direction, he stumbled upon the classic movie "Sleepless in Seattle" and immediately fell in love with the city or with Meg Ryan. Whichever it was, he moved to Seattle soon after where he still lives, works, and gets wet.</p>
