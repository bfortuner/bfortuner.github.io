<!-- BEGIN blog/about/index.html -->
<p>Brendan Fortuner grew up in the small town of Litchfield, Connecticut. He left shortly after to attend the University of Virginia where he wrote for a humor publication, joined a fraternity, sang in an all-male a capella group, and from time to time, attended class. Despite his greatest desire to remain at the university forever, a minor administrative oversight involving the incorrect rounding of floats gave him one credit too many and he was promptly graduated in 2012. He now lives in Seattle, Washington where he drinks coffee and works at Amazon.</p>
